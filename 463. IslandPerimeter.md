## 463. Island Perimeter ##
### You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island. ###

这道题就是求周长，这里有一个简便的算法，就是我们先计算1的个数，然后将其乘以4，这是理想状态下的长度，但是1和1之间会有交界处，我们统计交界处的个数，乘以2，再用之前求得的长度减去这个长度即可。

我之前写的算法如下：
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int cnt = 0;
        int line = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == 1){
                    cnt++;
                    if(j == n-1 && i+1 < m && grid[i][j] == grid[i+1][j])
                        line++;
                    if(i == m-1 && j+1 <n && grid[i][j] == grid[i][j+1])
                        line++;
                    
                    if(j!= n-1 && i!= m-1 && grid[i][j] == grid[i+1][j])
                        line++;
                    if(j!= n-1 && i!= m-1 && grid[i][j] == grid[i][j+1])
                        line++;
                }
            }
        }
        int num = cnt * 4;
        return num-line*2;
        
        
    }
};
```
前面两个if条件是为了适应假如只有一个元素，比如[[1]]的情况，因为我们只是去看右边的和下面的。但是看到别人写的，他是只考虑上面的和左面的，这样完美的涵盖了只有一个元素的情况。

find how many 1 in the map. If without the consideration of surrounding cells, the total perimeter should be the total amount of 1 times 4.
find how many cell walls that connect with both lands. We need to deduct twice of those lines from total perimeter
int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int count=0, repeat=0;
        for(int i=0;i<grid.size();i++)
        {
            for(int j=0; j<grid[i].size();j++)
                {
                    if(grid[i][j]==1)
                    {
                        count ++;
                        if(i!=0 && grid[i-1][j] == 1) repeat++;
                        if(j!=0 && grid[i][j-1] == 1) repeat++;
                    }
                }
        }
        return 4*count-repeat*2;
    }
```
这样就少了两个if条件 ，其实像这样的题要注意边界条件的处理！
